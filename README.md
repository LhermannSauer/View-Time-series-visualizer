### Assignment

For this project you will visualize time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots. You will use Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03. The data visualizations will help you understand the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth.




* Create a `draw_box_plot` function that uses Searborn to draw two adjacent box plots similar to "examples/Figure_3.png". These box plots should show how the values are distributed within a given year or month and how it compares over time. The title of the first chart should be "Year-wise Box Plot (Trend)" and the title of the second chart should be "Month-wise Box Plot (Seasonality)". Make sure the month labels on bottom start at "Jan" and the x and x axis are labeled correctly.





For each chart, make sure to use a copy of the data frame. Unit tests are written for you under `test_module.py`.

### Development

For development, you can use `main.py` to test your functions. Click the "run" button and `main.py` will run.

### Testing 

We imported the tests from `test_module.py` to `main.py` for your convenience. The tests will run automatically whenever you hit the "run" button.

### Submitting

Copy your project's URL and submit it to freeCodeCamp.
